# Pytorch_MNIST
Pytorch CNN &amp; VAE using MNIST dataset
MNIST is a prefect start point to dive into deep learning and train models.

I used MNIST dataset to conduct two mini-projects.

1. Compare GD vs GD with Momentum  
2. Variational Auto Encoder to learn latent representation and generate same figure: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fN4sxUk90rN5eoYck9aNCIcXmYgjGqMV
